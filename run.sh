# Plans the deployment - what needs to be created/removed and plans out a provisioning plan based on resource dependencies 
#
# Note: Terraform is able to dynamically create Resource Groups within TF Templates.  You do not need to create RGs in advance
#
# Terraform automatically looks for a parameters file - terraform.tfvars.  You can specify anotehr file with the -var-file flag
# You may also pass in parameters/variables via shell export TF_VAR_variable_name or via the command line with a -var flag
# See: https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/values/variables.html#variable-definition-precedence

# -auto-approve flag is optional but for automated environments you should use this flag to automatically deploy the resources without human/user interaction (i.e y/n input)
